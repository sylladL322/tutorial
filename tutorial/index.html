  <h1><a href="index.htm">Jump to Barzoom</a></h1>
  <p>This is a page with links to places and people in the
  magical country of Barzoom.</p>
  <p>Barzoom has lots of people and lots of places and the
  links below show you lists of all the wonderful people.
  Some of the people aren’t really people, they’re more
  goblins and dwarfs and trolls and things, but hey! We
  did say this is a magic kingdom.</p>
